# Quiz
My solutions to common (or not so common) interview quiz questions.

So far I have two items:

1. Magic Box - an exploration and comaprison of Java 8 Lambdas to other concurrent methods for solving the Magic Box problem.
2. Find Less Than or Equal - Find the max value less than or equal to another value in a sorted circular array.
